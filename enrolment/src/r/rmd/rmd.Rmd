# Title

[Source](https://data.gov.sg/dataset/universities-intake-enrolment-and-graduates-by-course)

Source Notes:

- Universities refers to
  - **NUS** National University of Singapore
  - **NTU** Nanyang Technological University
  - **SMU** Singapore Management University
  - **SIT** Singapore Institute of Technology
  - **SUTD** Singapore University of Technology & Design
  - **SUSS** Singapore University of Social Sciences.
- Intake, enrolment and graduates figures refer to full-time first degree only.
- Intake figures include students who entered directly into second and subsequent years.
- Courses are classified according to course content of the highest weighting.

## Columns

- **Year**: Year of dataset collected.
- **Sex**: Sex of group
- **Course**: Course the group of students attended
- **Intake**: Number of students accepted in to the course
- **Enrolment**: Number of students applied to the course
- **Graduates**: Number of students finishing the course

### Course

There are a myraid of courses provided by universities, however, this dataset narrows
it down to a few categories only.

This means that courses, for example, **Electrical Engineering** will fall under
**Engineering Sciences**, which is a more encompassing category.

### Intake vs. Enrolment

- **Intake** refers to students accepted.
- **Enrolment** refers to students applied.

Hence,
$$\frac{intake}{enrolment} = intake_{rate}$$ 

### Graduates

To clarify, this is the graduates for the particular year, which is independent of the
intake in the same year.

Hence it will not be possible to calculate graduation rate directly from this dataset:
$$\frac{graduates}{intake} \neq graduate_{rate}$$

## Goals

- It's pretty obvious that intake, enrolment, graduates will increase, but will there be some spikes in the graph that may prove otherwise between specific years?
- What is the intake and enrolment per course?
- Can we approximate the intake rate for each course? Is this reliable?


# Trends in Intake, Enrolment, and Graduates

## Observations

The obvious trend would be that all of them increase, but are they increasing at a proportional rate?

### Enrolment vs Intake

This can be also taken as **acceptance rate** by the university/course.

Let's take a look at the ratio on 2017, compare it against 2005

$$\frac{intake_{2005}}{enrolment_{2005}} = 13/44 \approx 29.5\%$$
$$\frac{intake_{2017}}{enrolment_{2017}} = 19/68 \approx 27.9\%$$

It shows a $1.6\%$ decrease.

*Note: We will not compare against graduates, as we discussed before, graduates are dependent on intakes/enrolments that happened years before*

## Forecasting

With this, can we conclude and forecast that **acceptance rate** will decrease? In a way, yes, however, we skimmed over an important aspect in this analysis.

### Is this really Intake Rate? 
**enrolment**, this value is dependent on the number of courses each student applied. This is, to a certain degree, dependent on the number of courses the universities offered. 

If more universities are established, more courses are provided, hence there will be more applications to courses. However, the student will only be accepted to one course, or none at all.
