# Journal :paperclip:

This is where I log all my lessons learnt while I was doing this project

## Entries

All entries of this journal will be crafted as accurately as possible,
I have split these into 3 simple categories
```
### Issue Discovered

What is the issue that I found?

### Proposed Solution

What are the solutions that I can think of?

### Solutions in hindsight

In hindsight, did the previous solutions work?

## Purpose :mag:

This journal is mainly made for me, to discuss what I've learnt for the past few days, 
into a simple document.

Even though I'm making this public, the journals may seem more personalized than one
crafted for the public eyes, however, I'll try my best to summarize it into bite-sized
info

#### Side Notes

- All entries' source are from a YAML Format, knitted into a HTML, then converted into a PDF.
- Dates may be off by a few days as I won't regularly update this folder.
