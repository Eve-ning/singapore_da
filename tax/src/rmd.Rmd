## Goals

We can look at the surface trends of this data provided, such as:
- How has the economy grown over the years?
- Has the disparity between the income groups increased, what is the trend?
- How is tax related to the income groups, is it fair?

# Number of Taxpayers By Income Groups

Taxed amounts aside, we can analyse how many people are in specific **income groups** by looking at the data.

We will simply drop these data into a ggplot where we group them by their income groups.

It is a straightforward incline for all income groups from 2004 onwards, however, there has been anomalies where some income groups have dropped
